##This file contains three problems related to random number generation, distribution analysis, and testing statistical independence. Each sheet addresses a specific task:

###Problem-1: Analyzes the frequency distribution of generated random numbers by categorizing them into bins and calculating their frequency.

###Problem-2: Investigates the uniformity and independence of random numbers, evaluating them under different conditions and calculating their percentages of occurrence.

###Problem-3: Demonstrates the process of Random Number Generation (RNG) using a linear congruential generator formula, highlighting key concepts like periodicity and normalization of random values.
